This extension adds a WYSIWYG editor for HTML files to File Manager. Compared with the built-in Code Editor, Rich Editor allows you to:

- Edit HTML as easily as you would edit a regular text file. The editor automatically adds the necessary tags.
- Choose from a variety of styles. Add headers, bullet lists, and links. Make your page stand out by adding images and videos.
- Built-in spellchecker takes care of the annoying typos.
- No HTML knowledge necessary!
